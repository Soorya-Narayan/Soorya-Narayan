## About me

Hi there ðŸ‘‹. I'm Surya Narayanan. My passion lies in 3D animation, where I bring creative visions to life using Blender and TouchDesigner. Alongside this, I manage artists on music concerts/festivals. I'm also proficient in web app development, creating robust and efficient applications.

In my free time, I indulge in stand-up comedy, spreading joy with my unique humor. I also give back to the community through blogging, speaking engagements, and open-sourcing my ideas. When I'm not developing apps or animations, you can find me contemplating the mysteries of the universe or preparing my next comedy set.
